I am a graduate student in applied mathematics at Gebze Technical University, Institute of Science, Department of Mathematics. My passion for mathematics led me to explore new areas of knowledge, and I have recently transitioned into the field of software development with a focus on frontend and React development.

In addition to my mathematical background, I have also developed a keen interest in data science, statistical analysis, and mathematical modeling. I am currently engaged in research projects that involve leveraging machine learning algorithms for drought prediction. This work allows me to apply my mathematical skills in a practical and impactful way, contributing to the development of sustainable solutions.

As a software developer, I am continuously expanding my skill set and keeping up with the latest trends in the industry. I am enthusiastic about creating intuitive user interfaces and crafting efficient, scalable code. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams, problem-solving, and delivering high-quality software solutions.

I believe that my strong foundation in applied mathematics, coupled with my newfound expertise in software development, equips me with a unique perspective to tackle complex problems from different angles. I am excited to embark on this new journey and contribute to innovative projects that combine my mathematical expertise with my software development skills.
